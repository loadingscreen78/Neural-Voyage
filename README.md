### 📘 Updated README (with Homepage + Timeline Images)

```markdown
# 🧠 Neural Odyssey

### _An immersive journey through the evolution of human consciousness — from ancient wisdom to artificial intelligence._

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Neural Odyssey** is an interactive and visually rich web experience that blends history, science, and technology into an AI-powered storytelling journey.  
It allows users to explore pivotal moments that shaped human understanding and artificial intelligence — from **Aristotle’s theory of memory** to the **rise of generative AI**.

This project serves as a **history fact checker, visual timeline, and educational experience**, providing insight into how human cognition evolved into machine intelligence.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧭 **Interactive Timeline:** Scroll through centuries of human evolution and AI milestones.  
- 🎨 **Immersive Design:** 3D neural visuals, parallax motion, and smooth animations built with Spline & modern web tech.  
- 🧠 **Fact-Checked History Cards:** Concise, verified facts about each historical event or concept.  
- ⚡ **AI-Powered Insights (optional):** Future integration to analyze and summarize events dynamically.  
- 🌐 **Responsive UI:** Fully optimized for desktop and mobile experiences.  
- 📚 **Educational Mode:** Timeline chapters guide users through key eras in consciousness and AI.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Landing Page:**  
   Introduces users to the concept — *“An immersive journey through the evolution of consciousness.”*

2. **Interactive Timeline:**  
   Users scroll or click through key historical milestones like:
   - 400 BCE — Aristotle’s Theory of Memory  
   - 1600 CE — Galileo’s Telescope  
   - 1943 — First Artificial Neuron  
   - 1956 — Birth of AI  
   - 2017 — Transformer Architecture  
   - 2023 — Generative AI Mainstream  

3. **Dynamic Transitions & UI:**  
   Smooth scroll, 3D backgrounds, and timeline animations powered by Spline + Framer Motion.

4. **Educational Expansion (Planned):**  
   Integrate an AI assistant to fact-check or explain each event using LLM APIs.
